# User manual for working with me

## The best ways to communicate with me...

- I have a profound hearing impairement and wear a cochlear implant. My journey in developing speech began at the age of 6 through speech therapy. While I don't use sign language, I have honed the skill of lip reading to enhance my communication abilities, especially when interacting with others.

## Conditions I like to work in

- I prefer working remotely, and one of the benefits is having access to Zoom closed captioning. It makes my work more comfortable and ensures that I can fully understand conversations when collaborating with my peers.
- Working from home also provides me with all the necessary tools and monitors to maximize my productivity. It ensures that I can fully grasp and benefit from listening during collaborations with my coworkers.
- That being said, I can manage without closed captioning and have done so through several years of work experience. However, I've reached a point where I rely on it, feeling less exhausted and performing better with it turned on.

## When I'm dealing with stress
- I generally find it helpful to step away from the computer to collect my thoughts. This may involve going for a walk or watching my favourite TV show for a bit.

## The best way to give me feedback

- In writing, I often miss details when seeking feedback, but in-person feedback is equally valuable. Ideally, both work well together. This approach helps me improve my skills regardless of the situation.

## My absolute requirements to do great work
- Three monitors are a must for my workspace to maximize productivity: one for Zoom, ensuring closed captioning is always readily available; one for code and designs; and one for my live build of the platform/website.
- Ergonomic chair.
- Proper desk.
- High-end mouse (Razer).
- Mouse pad (Steelseries).
- Rubiks cube thinking about my code.
- Additionally, having sticky notes and pens available nearby to jot down thoughts is an added benefit.

## Things I struggle with
- My biggest struggle is listening and retaining information that I didn't hear. As someone who is deaf, listening is not my strongest skill set; I will always grapple with it. Using the proper tools mentioned above is the best way to ensure I catch everything.
- Patience is absolutely key in this; sometimes, I need time to read the captions or may need to repeat once or twice for the point to sink in.

## Other things to know about me
- Enthusiastic about sports, music, games, food, and global exploration, my foremost passion revolves around playing the guitar and attempting to conquer those iconic guitar riffs.
- I also enjoy visiting as many countries and continents as I can. I have a strong interest in geography and find it fascinating to learn about the various ways people live in different countries, which I hope to experience.
- I'm Jewish, I take pleasure in sharing insights into our customs and practices. I allocate specific periods for special holidays, during which I celebrate with my family.
