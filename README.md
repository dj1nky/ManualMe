# User manual for working with me


## About me
I was born with a profound hearing impairement, and at age three, began wearing a Cochlear device on my left ear. My journey in speech development began later than most, and I underwent intensive speech therapy during my schooling years. I do not use sign language, but am currently in the process of learning it, so I am better able to communicate with the hearing impaired community. I have also developed some unique skills over the years to help me hear better, such as lip reading. (If you have seen Seinfeld, yes, I do get 'sweeping' and 'sleeping' confused like Marlee Matlin, and whilst my lip reading is not flawless, it is pretty decent, especially for people I communicate with regularly!)

## The best ways to communicate with me
If you are communicating with me through video calls, I would really appreciate if you please:
- Turn your camera on
- Face your camera front on (so I can read your lips)
- Use a microphone or clear audio device, with no background noises
- Allow me to turn on transcripts/subtitles for our calls

If you are communicating with me in person, I would really appreciate if you please:
- Do not cover your lips (i.e. no facemasks, eating whilst talking or putting your hand over your mouth)
- Allow me to select where to sit (As I only have a Cochlear device on one ear, I have a 'better' side, so I try to sit in locations which allow me to hear everyone best)
- Face me when talking
- Sometimes I will use my microphone (I'm not recording you, rather it goes straight to my Cochlear device so I can hear you better)
- If you are talking to me and I'm on my phone or apple watch, I promise I am not ignoring you or playing a round of Tetris - my phone and watch work as remote controls to my Cochlear device, and I often use my phone and watch to adjust the settings in different social environments

## Myths and fun facts about communicating with the hearing impaired community
When communicating with me, there is no need to talk slower or louder. Often people will make assumptions that as I am deaf and my tone of voice sounds slightly different, that this means I don't understand what they are saying, and if I ask them to repeat, that they need to simplify their language. This isn't the case. If I ask you to repeat its simply that I didn't hear you properly the first time, and as I value what you are saying, I want to make sure I have got it correct. An interesting fact, is that I do not always wear my Cochlear device, and when I am not wearing it, I am completely deaf - I sometimes take my Cochlear device off when working individually as it helps my focus.

## Conditions I like to work in
- Whilst I enjoy working onsite, I have a preference for working remotely, as I have access to Zoom closed captioning and transcripts, and as mentioned eariler, can better read lips, especially in group meetings where I can see everyone lips and their microphones are close to the mouths. This ensures that I can fully understand conversations when collaborating with my peers.
- Working from home also ensures I have all the necessary tools and monitors to maximize my productivity. It ensures that I can fully grasp and benefit from listening during collaborations with my coworkers. For example, I have a microphone connected through my computer to my Cochlear device.
- That being said, I can manage without closed captioning and have worked in teams onsite for many years.

## The best way to give me feedback
I appreciate feedback wherever possible. I do have a preference for feedback in writing, in addition to a verbal conversation via video call, so I can thoroughly take the feedback on board and refer to it when need, to further develop my skills. I am always happy to recieve feedback verbally, even if it is in person, but I may ask you to repeat to ensure I am taking the feedback on board.

## Things I struggle with
- Face masks - a deaf persons kryptonite! Covid brought about great developments in online communciations - especially transcripts of video calls, however, it also brought face masks - and whilst I fully support the use of face masks and keeping our community healthy and safe, I do ask that you please remove facemasks when talking with me, as I can't read lips. Alternatively, there are clear facemasks which can be purchased which do make lip reading easier, however still does muffle sound.  
- As someone who is deaf, listening is not my strongest skill. Using the proper tools mentioned above is the best way to ensure I catch everything, however I will ask you to repeat yourself (which I know can be annoying) but its only because I value what you are saying.
- Patience is absolutely key in this; sometimes, I need time to read the captions or may need to repeat once or twice to ensure I correctly understand a point.
- I do sometimes struggle hearing individuals with accents as I can't rely on lip reading, so I sometimes will ask you to repeat yourself or write it down.
Whilst it has its challenges, mishearing does often bring about laughter - and I am always having a joke about some of the things I mishear!

## Other things to know about me
- I am enthusiastic about sports, games, food, and global exploration. Perhaps suprisingly, my foremost passion revolves around playing the guitar and attempting to conquer those iconic guitar riffs, in addition to my love for music. There have been some great developments over the years to Cochlear devices, and whilst I was a child I didn't really like music because of the poor sound quality through the device, now, with the latest Cochlear device I am able to listen to music directly to my Cochlear and can listen to music just like everyone else.
- I also enjoy visiting as many countries and continents as I can. I have a strong interest in geography and find it fascinating to learn about the various ways people live in different countries, which I hope to experience. My party trick is being able to name and label all the countries in the world in under 10 minutes.
- I value family and friends, and when I am not working, you will often find me spending time with my family
